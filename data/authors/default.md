### Background

Hey, I’m Duncan, a self-taught developer, writer and an open source enthusiast exploring what’s possible on the web and in software.

I like to spend my time building projects that interest me, as well as pushing myself to learn more through open source projects and share my knowledge with other developers.

### What I’ve been up to

I've been recently focused on building React (specifically Next.js) applications, using popular tools such as Tailwind, Prisma and GraphQl and to help me bring my designs.

### Interests

I’m currently interested in building tools that help us make things developing faster and more efficient.

I’m also really into low level programming with Rust and C/

When I'm not coding (or writing or reading about it) you'll typically find me engaging with another creative or engaging activity such as design, gaming, curating playlists, solving rubik's cube or getting lost in series!

Although I love to keep myself busy with activities, I make sure to set aside to going for walks and runs.
