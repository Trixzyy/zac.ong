title: Privacy Policy
description: Hey there! This is where I let you know what happens to your data when you use my site. I like to keep things transparent, so here's the deal.
---

## What I collect

- **Emails**: I store the email addresses provided through GitHub OAuth. It stays private and isn’t shared with anyone. I might use it to reach out to you about new projects, but that's about it.
- **Guestbook content**: Everything you write in the guestbook gets saved in a secure cloud libSQL database hosted by **Turso in London**. I check in from time to time to make sure everything's appropriate.
- **Analytics**: I use **Vercel Analytics** to see how people interact with the site. This helps me get insights on things like the devices you're using, the platform you're on, and how you navigate the site. No personal data from this though.

## How long I keep it

- I keep all this data **forever**, but you can ask me to delete it at any time. Just drop me an email at **[zac@tigerlake.xyz](mailto:zac@tigerlake.xyz)** or message me on Discord at **[@trixzy](https://discord.com/users/992171799536218142)**, and I’ll take care of it.

## No third-party sharing

- I don’t share your data with any third parties. Your info stays between us, unless there's some super legal reason I have to hand it over (but let's hope it doesn't come to that).

## Your rights

- You can ask to:
  - See the data I've got on you.
  - Update or correct it if something's wrong.
  - Have your data deleted if you want it gone.

## Security stuff

- I take security seriously. Your data is stored in a secure cloud database, and I'm using industry-standard encryption to keep it safe. While I do my best, no system is 100% foolproof, so just be aware that risks exist online.

## Age restrictions

- I don’t actively check for age, so it’s all on you to decide if you're cool with using the site. There's no content here that's age-restricted, so it’s pretty chill.

## Changes to this policy

- If I ever decide to update this policy, I’ll post it here. Keep an eye out if you're into that sort of thing.
