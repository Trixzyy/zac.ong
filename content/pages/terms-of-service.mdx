title: Terms Of Service
description: Hey! If you're reading this, you're either really into digging around code or just super curious. Either way, welcome to this not-so-secret Terms of Service page. Let's keep this casual but clear. Here's how things roll on my site
---
## Don't be that person

- **No spamming** – Please don't spam or promote yourself in my guestbook.
- **No attacks** – Don't mess with the site. Seriously, no attacks, hacks, or any funny business.

## Your content, my rules

- The guestbook data gets uploaded to a secure cloud libSQL database hosted by **Turso in London**.
- I keep an eye on what’s posted and have the right to delete anything I find inappropriate. Don’t take it personally; I’m just keeping things chill for everyone.

## Your email

- I store emails provided through GitHub OAuth, but **no third parties** are involved. Your info stays with me.
- I might hit you up with updates about new projects or things I’m working on, but nothing spammy, I promise.

## Liability

- If something breaks, goes down, or doesn't work as you expect, I'm **not liable** for any issues that come up. This is a personal site, after all.

## Terms changes and user accounts

- I reserve the right to change these terms if needed. If things get really wild, I might have to delete your account. Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.

## Law and disputes

- Honestly, I’m not sure what law stuff applies here yet, but I’m based in the UK, so that’s probably the go-to.
