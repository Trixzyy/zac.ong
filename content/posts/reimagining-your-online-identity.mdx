There’s something about leaving behind an old username that feels like a fresh start. For me, stepping away from my old name wasn't just a decision—it was a shift in how I want to present myself online. My old identity? It was part of a past version of me, tied to gaming and content creation that, frankly, I’ve outgrown. Now, I’m focused on building something real, something that reflects where I’m heading.

### A New Beginning: Zac

This change isn’t just cosmetic—it’s about authenticity. My name is Zac, and it’s who I want to be online. Nothing flashy, no frills, just me. The new website at [**zac.ong**](/) represents that step forward. It’s more than a place to post blogs; it’s a way to define myself under my own name, showing the work I’m proud of. Whether it’s coding projects like [*discord-authjs-example*](https://github.com/Trixzyy/discord-authjs-example) or personal initiatives, I want this space to reflect my growth.

### Some Thoughts on Rebranding

If you’re considering rebranding or changing your online persona, think about where you are right now and where you want to go. For me, transitioning to just “Zac” wasn’t a gimmick; it was about being genuine to myself. I communicate through spaces like Discord, where I focus on my coding projects and development work. Having an identity that’s grounded in my real name helps me stay connected to who I am—and who I’m becoming.

### Final Thoughts

Reimagining my online identity felt like a natural next step. Moving away from an old name that didn’t fit anymore allowed me to embrace my work and my growth. The site **zac.ong** is more than just a domain; it’s a reflection of that change. If you’re thinking about making a similar move, do it when it feels right. It’s a chance to align your identity with your purpose, and that’s something worth doing.
