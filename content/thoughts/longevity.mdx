Recently, I've been fascinated by the scientific pursuit of extending human lifespan. While exploring this topic, I discovered the work of [David Sinclair](https://genetics.med.harvard.edu/sinclair/), a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School. His research on aging and longevity opened my eyes to the incredible complexity of how we age and the potential ways to influence this process.

One particularly intriguing concept in longevity research is the role of NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) in cellular health. This molecule is crucial for various biological processes, including DNA repair and energy production. As we age, our NAD+ levels naturally decline, which may contribute to the aging process. The equation below represents a simplified model of NAD+ decline over time:
